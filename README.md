## Calgary-Crime-Data-Analysis-and-Neural-Network-Prediction

The aim of this project is to use the Crime and Disorder Data provided by the City of Calgary's data website to analyze the data and predict the number of crimes that will occur in the future. The data is from 2018 to 2024 and contains the number of crimes that occurred in Calgary for each month. After throughly analyzing the data, I will be building a neural network model and optimizing it to predict the number of crimes that will occur in the future

## Strategy

 1. Loading the data and understanding the data
 2. Data Preprocessing - cleaing the data and preparing it for analysis
 3. Exploratory Data Analysis - Analyzing the data to understand the trends and patterns
 4. Building a Neural Network Model
 5. Optimizing the model
 6. Training the model
 7. Predicting the number of crimes that will occur in the future
